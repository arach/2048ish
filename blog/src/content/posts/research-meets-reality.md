What happens when you take a strategy from academic research and pit it against modern empirical approaches? We found out by implementing the **SmoothnessStrategy** from a 2014 research paper and putting it through our benchmarking gauntlet.

The results were fascinating - and opened up entirely new directions for strategy development.

## The Academic Foundation

While building our benchmarking framework, we discovered we had an **unfinished implementation** of a strategy based on the 2014 paper "An AI for 2048 - Part 4 Evaluation Functions." The paper tested three core heuristics:

- **Smoothness**: Minimize differences between adjacent tiles  
- **Monotonicity**: Prefer sorted rows and columns
- **Empty Tiles**: Maximize available space

The research found that **smoothness was the strongest single heuristic**, achieving 720 average score and reaching the 1024 tile - significantly outperforming monotonicity (420) and empty tiles (390).

## Our Implementation

We implemented the research findings as a weighted evaluation function:

```typescript
// Weights based on academic research - smoothness is primary
private weights = {
  smoothness: 0.5,   // 50% - research shows this is most important
  monotonicity: 0.3, // 30% - helps with organization
  emptyTiles: 0.15,  // 15% - survival factor
  cornerBonus: 0.05  // 5% - high tiles in corners
};
```

### Smoothness Calculation

The core insight is measuring how "smooth" the board is by minimizing tile value differences:

```typescript
private calculateSmoothness(grid: Grid): number {
  let smoothness = 0;
  
  for (let r = 0; r < 4; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < 4; c++) {
      if (grid[r][c]) {
        const currentValue = grid[r][c]!;
        
        // Check right neighbor
        if (c < 3 && grid[r][c + 1]) {
          const diff = Math.abs(currentValue - grid[r][c + 1]!);
          smoothness -= diff; // Subtract because we want smaller differences
        }
        
        // Check down neighbor  
        if (r < 3 && grid[r + 1][c]) {
          const diff = Math.abs(currentValue - grid[r + 1][c]!);
          smoothness -= diff;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  return smoothness;
}
```

The strategy evaluates each possible move and chooses the one that optimizes the weighted combination of all heuristics.

## The Benchmark Results

Running our comprehensive 100-game benchmark revealed surprising results:

### **Performance Rankings:**

| Strategy | Avg Score | Speed | Type | Achievement |
|----------|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Greedy** | 3,079 | 1.99ms | Empirical | 🏆 Still champion |
| **Expectimax** | 2,365 | 593ms | Empirical | 🧠 Sophisticated |
| **Smoothness Master** | 2,142 | 2.41ms | **Research** | 🔬 Academic approach |
| **Corner Master** | 1,542 | 0.23ms | Empirical | ⚡ Speed demon |
| **Snake Builder** | 1,241 | 0.54ms | Empirical | 🐍 Needs work |

### **Key Findings:**

**1. Research Exceeded Expectations**  
Our SmoothnessStrategy achieved **2,142 average score** - nearly **3x better** than the original paper's 720! This suggests significant improvements from:
- Better move simulation implementation
- Modern game engine optimizations  
- Refined weight tuning

**2. Empirical Still Leads**  
Despite solid performance, our simple **Greedy strategy outperformed** the research approach by 44% (3,079 vs 2,142). Sometimes simple heuristics beat complex weighted combinations.

**3. Speed vs Intelligence Tradeoff**  
SmoothnessStrategy runs at 2.41ms per game - reasonably fast while being more thoughtful than pure greed. Compare to Expectimax's 593ms for only 10% better performance.

**4. The Winning Problem**  
Here's the sobering reality: **none of our strategies actually win the game**. Across 600 total games (100 per strategy), we achieved exactly **0 wins** - zero games reached the 2048 tile.

Our best achievements:
- **Greedy**: Reached 1024 once, 512 nine times
- **SmoothnessStrategy**: Reached 512 six times  
- **Expectimax**: Reached 512 once

This reveals a fundamental gap between "playing well" and "winning consistently."

## What Made the Difference?

The dramatic improvement over the original research (2,142 vs 720) likely came from:

**Implementation Quality:**
- Proper move simulation vs placeholder logic
- Accurate smoothness calculations
- Optimized evaluation functions

**Modern Context:**
- Better random number generation
- More robust game state handling
- Faster computational cycles allowing deeper evaluation

**Weight Refinement:**
- The 50/30/15/5 weight distribution appears well-tuned
- Corner bonus addition helps with late-game positioning
- Balanced approach prevents over-optimization

## The Winning Challenge

Our 0% win rate across all strategies highlights a critical issue: **we're optimizing for the wrong metric**. All our strategies focus on maximizing score, but the actual goal is reaching 2048.

This suggests several fundamental problems:

**1. Short-Term Thinking**: Strategies prioritize immediate gains over long-term positioning needed for 2048.

**2. Risk Aversion**: Conservative play that maximizes average score might not take the risks needed for the big win.

**3. Endgame Weakness**: Getting from 1024 to 2048 requires different tactics than early/mid-game optimization.

**4. Evaluation Mismatch**: Our heuristics reward "good-looking" boards rather than win probability.

## Ideas for Improvement

The research foundation and winning challenge open exciting possibilities:

### **1. Dynamic Weight Adjustment**
```typescript
// Adapt weights based on game phase
private getWeights(moveCount: number, maxTile: number) {
  if (moveCount < 50) {
    // Early game: prioritize space and smoothness
    return { smoothness: 0.4, emptyTiles: 0.4, monotonicity: 0.2 };
  } else if (maxTile >= 256) {
    // Late game: focus on organization  
    return { monotonicity: 0.5, smoothness: 0.3, cornerBonus: 0.2 };
  }
  // Default research weights
  return this.weights;
}
```

### **2. Multi-Depth Smoothness**
Instead of only checking adjacent tiles, evaluate smoothness patterns at multiple scales:

```typescript
// Check 2-tile and 3-tile smoothness patterns
private calculateMultiScaleSmoothness(grid: Grid): number {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Adjacent smoothness (current)
  score += this.calculateSmoothness(grid) * 0.6;
  
  // 2-tile gap smoothness  
  score += this.calculateGapSmoothness(grid, 2) * 0.3;
  
  // 3-tile gap smoothness
  score += this.calculateGapSmoothness(grid, 3) * 0.1;
  
  return score;
}
```

### **3. Learning-Enhanced Research**
Combine research heuristics with learned patterns:

```typescript
// Use research weights as baseline, adjust based on observed outcomes
private adaptiveWeights = {
  baseline: { smoothness: 0.5, monotonicity: 0.3, emptyTiles: 0.15 },
  learned: { /* weights adjusted from successful games */ },
  confidence: 0.0 // How much to trust learned vs research
};
```

### **4. Hybrid Greedy-Smoothness**
Since Greedy performs so well, create a hybrid approach:

```typescript
// Combine immediate merge potential with smoothness
private evaluateHybrid(gameState: GameState, move: Direction): number {
  const greedyScore = this.countImmediateMerges(gameState, move) * 100;
  const smoothnessScore = this.evaluateSmoothness(gameState, move);
  
  // Weight immediate gains vs long-term board quality
  return greedyScore * 0.7 + smoothnessScore * 0.3;
}
```

### **5. Win-Oriented Evaluation**
Redesign evaluation functions to prioritize win probability over score:

```typescript
private evaluateWinPotential(gameState: GameState): number {
  const maxTile = this.getMaxTile(gameState.grid);
  const emptyTiles = this.countEmptyTiles(gameState.grid);
  
  // Heavily weight positions that could lead to 2048
  if (maxTile >= 1024) {
    // Endgame: focus on creating 2048 opportunity
    return this.evaluateEndgamePosition(gameState) * 1000;
  } else if (maxTile >= 512) {
    // Late game: setup for 1024 merger
    return this.evaluateLateGamePosition(gameState) * 100;
  } else {
    // Early/mid game: build foundation
    return this.evaluateFoundationBuilding(gameState);
  }
}
```

### **6. Risk-Taking Strategies**
Develop strategies willing to sacrifice score for win probability:

```typescript
// Sometimes take risky moves that could lead to wins
private evaluateRiskyMoves(gameState: GameState): Direction | null {
  const conservativeMove = this.getBestScoreMove(gameState);
  const riskyMove = this.getBestWinProbabilityMove(gameState);
  
  // In endgame, prefer risky moves that could create 2048
  if (this.isEndgame(gameState)) {
    return riskyMove;
  }
  
  return conservativeMove;
}
```

## Research vs Reality Lessons

This experiment revealed several insights about academic research in practice:

**Research Provides Direction:** The paper's identification of smoothness as a key heuristic was spot-on, even if the implementation details needed work.

**Implementation Matters:** The gap between 720 and 2,142 shows how much difference proper implementation makes.

**Simple Can Win:** Sometimes a straightforward greedy approach outperforms sophisticated weighted combinations.

**Speed Matters:** For interactive gameplay, SmoothnessStrategy's 2.41ms is much more practical than Expectimax's 593ms.

**Hybrid Potential:** The best future strategies likely combine research insights with empirical observations.

## Future Experiments

The winning challenge and SmoothnessStrategy insights open up critical research directions:

1. **Win-First Strategies**: Develop strategies that prioritize reaching 2048 over maximizing score
2. **Endgame Specialization**: Create strategies specifically designed for 1024→2048 transitions  
3. **Risk/Reward Analysis**: Study when to take risks vs play conservatively
4. **Phase-Aware Evaluation**: Adapt strategy based on game progress toward 2048
5. **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Look ahead multiple moves to find win paths
6. **Academic Strategy Survey**: Implement more strategies from 2048 research papers
7. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Train neural networks on games that actually reach 2048

## Conclusion

This experiment revealed a fundamental tension between **playing well** and **winning consistently**. Our research-backed SmoothnessStrategy achieved solid performance (2,142 average score) but, like all our strategies, failed to actually beat the game.

The **0% win rate** across 600 games is a wake-up call: we've been optimizing for the wrong metric. Academic research focuses on board evaluation and score maximization, but the real challenge is reliably reaching 2048.

Key takeaways:

**Research Provides Foundation**: The smoothness heuristic proved valuable, with our implementation achieving 3x the original paper's performance.

**Implementation Quality Matters**: The gap between 720 and 2,142 shows how much proper implementation affects results.

**Wrong Optimization Target**: Maximizing average score ≠ maximizing win probability.

**Endgame Gap**: All strategies struggle with the crucial 1024→2048 transition.

**Hybrid Future**: The best strategies will likely combine research insights with win-focused evaluation.

The next phase of 2048 strategy development must shift from "how to play well" to "how to win consistently." That's a much harder problem - and a much more interesting one.

The data doesn't lie, but it also reveals we've been asking the wrong questions.
